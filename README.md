# Cryptography
The system uses Diffie-Hellman for secure key exchange, allowing two parties to agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel, protecting it from eavesdropping. AES with a 128-bit key in CBC mode is employed for symmetric encryption, balancing security and performance while providing robust protection for block-based data. SHA-256 is used to hash the shared secret and the initial message, ensuring both integrity and a strong representation of the secret.

A random Initialization Vector (IV) is generated for each encryption in CBC mode, enhancing security. The IV is shared between parties to enable decryption. The system includes error handling through the `handleErrors` function, which displays error messages and exits the program if a failure occurs. Lastly, the system provides clear output, including the hashed secret, ciphertext, and decrypted plaintext, to help verify the cryptographic processes.
